## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

* I made both the layout and the images responsive to desktop and mobile viewports.

* I preferred the height of the background image in the header section to be equal to 100% of the viewport's height. Then, I added interactivity to the arrow SVG element in order to direct user to the main content.

* Besides the main requirements of the challenge, I also added some extra hover effects to the navigation links and an transition effect to the mobile navigation toggle menu.
